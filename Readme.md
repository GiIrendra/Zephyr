# üí´ About Me:

This project has an operational website that is linked to a database that is managed by an admin panel.

# ‚ö†Ô∏é Problem Statement

# üî≠ Solution
The website features a modern and simple design, with complete responsiveness and cross-browser optimization. We have also integrated Google Map and Google Calendar functionalities, along with a PDF viewer.

The front-end of the website has exciting webpages that showcase different types of events, along with a registration form and details fetched from the database of events. We have also displayed the sponsors of the fest, along with a wonderful guest list.

Participants can easily register and get their unique ID, while the admin can manage the complete fest and look for other details, such as how many people have visited the website and how the event is performing on social media platforms.

The admin panel of the website is a full-featured, multipurpose admin built with Bootstrap 4 Framework, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. It is a fully responsive admin dashboard that is user-friendly and can be operated with great ease.

The admin panel has several menus, including Query Box, Event Menu, Managers Menu, Participants Menu, Volunteers Menu, Sponsors Menu, and Chief Guests Menu. The interface also includes a Google Map to showcase all venues related to events, along with a PDF viewer.
